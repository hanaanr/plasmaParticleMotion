# Particle Motion in a Plasma

Hanaan Shafi & War War Myint Myat Phyo

As the title suggests, this project attempts to visualize particle motion in a plasma. We first begin with the motion of positive and negative ions in only either an electric or magnetic field, followed by crossed electric and magnetic fields. Then, we move on to motion of ions in the presence of a gravitational force in addition to a magnetic field. Finally, we visualize motion in the presence of a simple time-varying magnetic field.
